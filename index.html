                        Dear Love (Maya),<br>
                        I hope this letter finds you well and brings a smile to your face. I just got an idea to write a
                        letter to you to share what's in my heart, but I really don’t know what to write. I am, indeed,
                        not best at putting my feelings into words. <br>
                        <br>
                        But anyways, I know you already knew it but still, I love you so much. I don’t know how and why
                        I caught feelings for you but since that day, I knew that you are the one for me. I was not
                        looking for any relationships but your aura was different. Your beauty, your elegance, your
                        innocence were irresistible, and slowly, I found myself falling deeply in love with you.
                        It was a gradual descent, yet it turned out to be the hardest and the most beautiful fall.
                        Receiving that text form you on September 10 felt like regaining lost treasure. I can still
                        recall
                        the immense joy I felt at that moment. I already know the pain of the thought of losing you and
                        that’s the reason I love you even more. Now, that you’re mine I want you to know that I’m gonna
                        do my best to keep you by my side. <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I may not be the perfect man for you, but I assure you, I’m trying my best. If I ever make
                        mistakes,
                        please correct me. If I ever annoy you, don't hesitate to let me know, but please never go away
                        form me. I value your guidance, and I promise to learn and grow from any missteps.
                        I love you so so soooooooo much. My love for you is boundless, and I am grateful for
                        every moment we share. <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you so much for choosing me. I look forward to creating lasting memories, overcoming
                        challenges hand in hand, and discovering the depth of our love as we navigate life together.
                        With each passing day, my love for you grows, and I am very excited about the many more chapters
                        we will write together. Here's to a future filled with love, laughter, and endless happiness.<br>
                        <br>
                        Forever Yours,<br>
